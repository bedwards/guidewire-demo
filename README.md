# Guidewire Demo

Demonstration of using the Guidewire software suite for property and casualty insurance companies, specifically developing rating rules and logic for policies, billing, and claims processing.

A property and casualty (P&C) insurance company provides coverage to protect your car, home, and other personal assets from damage or loss, as well as coverage for legal liabilities if you accidentally cause harm to others or their property. Three major property and casualty insurance companies are State Farm, Allstate, and GEICO.

Developing rating rules refers to defining and implementing the calculations used to determine the premiums charged for various insurance policies, as well as the procedures for invoicing customers and handling claims filed for covered losses.

The Guidewire software suite is a comprehensive platform used by property and casualty insurers, which includes tools for developing and maintaining rating rules and calculations through the Gosu programming language, a scripting language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing integration with Java libraries.

The Gosu programming language is open source, and documentation is provided publicly.
